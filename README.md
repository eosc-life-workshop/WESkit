# WESkit
Use WESkit to execute Nextflow and Snakemake workflows.

# WESkit workshop
In this workshop, we are going to use the open-source software WESkit that helps researchers to execute Nextflow and Snakemake workflows locally or remote (HPC). WESkit provides extensive logging capabilities, and a user management system, and supports high data throughput, stability, and security.
Participants will be encouraged to set up their own WESkit instance and use it to submit both Nextflow and Snakemake workflows.
