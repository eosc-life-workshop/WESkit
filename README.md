# WESkit workshop
In the first part of the workshop (`snakemake/`), we are going to use the SimpleVM to compose a Snakemake workflow and execute it locally.
In the second part of the workshop (`weskit/`), we are going to use the open-source software WESkit that helps researchers 
to execute Nextflow and Snakemake workflows locally or remote (HPC).
